# StopwatchGUI

StopwatchGUI is a simple stopwatch application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing. It allows you to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the StopwatchGUI repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the Java source file: javac StopwatchGUI.java

5. Run the application: java StopwatchGUI


6. The stopwatch window will appear with three labels for minutes, seconds, and tenths of seconds. The initial time is set to 00:00:00.
7. Click the "Start" button to start the stopwatch. The timer will begin incrementing the tenths of seconds.
8. Click the "Stop" button to pause the stopwatch. The timer will stop incrementing.
9. Click the "Reset" button to reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00.
10. Close the window or press Ctrl+C in the terminal to exit the application.

## Note

- The stopwatch measures time in tenths of seconds. It starts from 00:00:00 and increments the tenths of seconds up to 99, then increments the seconds, and finally increments the minutes.
- The "Start" button starts the timer, the "Stop" button pauses the timer, and the "Reset" button resets the timer.
- The window is automatically centered on the screen when it is launched.
