# Folder Locker

Folder Locker is a simple command-line Java application that allows you to lock and unlock folders using a password. When a folder is locked, it is renamed to a hidden name, making it less obvious to others that the folder is locked.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the Folder Locker repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the Java source file: javac FolderLocker.java
5. Run the application: java FolderLocker
   
6. Follow the prompts to enter the folder path and set a password for locking/unlocking the folder.

- If the folder is already locked, the application will unlock it.
- If the folder is not locked, the application will lock it.

7. The application will display a success message indicating whether the folder was locked or unlocked.

## Important Note

- The password is not securely stored in this example and is hashed only for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you should employ proper password storage and hashing techniques.
